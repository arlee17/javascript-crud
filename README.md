# Javascript ES21 CRUD

A simple CRUD application made with javascript ES21.

# Application
The application allows to Create, Read, Update and Delete personal notes.

# Javascript
The code is pure javascript,
no need to install any module, just clone the repository on your local machine and start the `index.html` in your browser.

# Exercise
This repository can be used as a base exercise for a javascript refactoring.
In fact there is a small bug that has to be fixed.
No comments have been added to the code to make the exercise a bit more complicated.

# Original source code
Done following the instructions of [Victor Robles](https://victorroblesweb.es/) in one of his online courses.
